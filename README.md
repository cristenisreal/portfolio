# Cristen Isreal – Project Portfolio

Hey there! I’m Cristen.  
Welcome to my project portfolio, where real-world business problems meet Python, R, automation, and a little creativity.

Here’s a quick tour of what I’ve built and how each project works, step-by-step:

---

## Consumer Debt Financing Modeling (Python)

Banks and lenders have one big question: Who’s a safe bet to lend to — and what should we charge them?  
I built a Python model that figures it out.

I pulled in consumer lending data (income, credit scores, debt ratios), cleaned it up, and grouped borrowers into low, medium, and high-risk categories.  
After that, I visualized trends using Matplotlib to see who’s most likely to default.

Then came the real magic: I built a dynamic pricing engine. It adjusts loan offers automatically based on a borrower's risk profile.  
Lower risk? Better rates. Higher risk? Higher rates.

In the end, this project gives lenders a smarter way to offer loans without gambling on guesswork.

## Email Automation Template (Python Logic Framework)

Nobody has time to manually send every marketing email anymore.  
I built a logic-driven system that figures out which email to send next — all based on what customers actually do.

First, I mapped out key customer actions like opening an email, clicking a link, or making a purchase.  
Then, I wrote simple Python logic to simulate those automated "if this, then that" marketing flows.

For example, if someone opens but doesn’t click, they get a reminder. If they click but don’t buy, they get a discount offer.  
The templates are modular, flexible, and easy to plug into a CRM.

The result is a smarter, fully-automated email system that keeps users engaged without needing a marketing team glued to a keyboard 24/7.

## Business Process Optimization (R Programming)

Ever wonder why some business processes feel like they move at a snail’s pace?  
I did too — so I built a tool in R to find out where things get stuck.

I started by mapping a basic workflow: Customer orders → Processing → Packaging → Shipping → Delivery.  
Then I simulated the time each step normally takes and used R scripts to track where delays pile up.

After spotting bottlenecks, I generated simple reports highlighting exactly which steps were slowing everything down — and how to fix them.

It’s a project that helps operations teams work smarter, hit deadlines faster, and avoid the frustration of constant bottlenecks.

## Python Pricing Automation Tool

Manually adjusting prices every time costs or demand changes is slow and painful.  
So I automated it.

This Python tool takes in base product costs, target profit margins, and even demand scores.  
It then calculates optimal selling prices dynamically — no calculator needed.

If demand spikes or supplier costs rise, the tool automatically adjusts prices based on built-in rules.  
I even simulated what-if scenarios to stress-test different pricing strategies.

The final result: a fast, flexible pricing engine that helps businesses stay competitive, protect profits, and adapt without breaking a sweat.

# Why These Projects Matter

Each project here is about more than just writing code — it's about solving real problems.

- Smarter lending decisions  
- Smarter customer engagement  
- Smarter operations  
- Smarter pricing strategies

Everything is tied back to helping companies move faster, make better decisions, and use data to their advantage.
